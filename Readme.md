# Frostbyte Terminal

I've always loved Yakuake on my KDE Desktop,
but I've been missing it dearly on other DE's and especially on windows.
Since I had to build a terminal widget for the [rust ui framework iced](https://iced.rs/) anyway,
I needed a test application. And after building the terminal itself,
I just went ahead and kept working on it a bit.

There's still a bit of work until it's ready for other users.
In the meantime, feel free to check out the code and maybe try it out yourself.
